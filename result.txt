## 🧪 Phishing Indicators Found

1. **Email Spoofing**:
   - Email address `support@paypa1.com` is a spoofed domain (uses "paypa**1**" instead of "paypal").
   - Sender name is misleading.

2. **Suspicious Links**:
   - URL displayed: `http://paypal.verify-user.com/login`  
   - Hovered URL doesn't match official PayPal domain (`paypal.com`).
   - Uses HTTP instead of secure HTTPS.

3. **Header Analysis**:
   - Analyzed with [MXToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
   - Revealed a mismatch between sending server and domain owner.

4. **Urgent/Threatening Language**:
   - "Urgent", "Failure to do so", "permanent suspension" triggers fear.

5. **Grammar and Spelling Errors**:
   - Sentence: “Failure to do so within 24 hours...” lacks professional tone.
   - Suspiciously generic greeting: “Dear User”.

6. **Attachment**:
   - `verify_account.pdf` — potentially malicious.
