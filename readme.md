1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities (like banks, government agencies, or popular websites) to trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as:

Passwords

Credit card numbers

Social Security numbers

Bank account details

It often comes through email, but can also happen via SMS (smishing), phone calls (vishing), or fake websites.

2. How to identify a phishing email?
Signs of a phishing email include:

Urgent or threatening language: “Your account will be suspended!”

Misspelled URLs or sender addresses: e.g., supp0rt@netfl1x.com

Grammar/spelling errors

Unexpected attachments or links

Generic greetings like “Dear customer” instead of your name

Requests for personal info or login credentials

3. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is when attackers forge the “From” address in an email to make it look like it’s from someone you trust.
It tricks you into thinking the email is legitimate so you’ll:

Click a malicious link

Download a harmful file

Give away sensitive information

4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
They are dangerous because they can:

Steal money, identity, and data

Infect your device or network with malware or ransomware

Give hackers access to sensitive business systems

Lead to long-term fraud or privacy breaches

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
Check the email address carefully – not just the name.

Hover over links to preview the destination URL.

Look for spelling mistakes or unprofessional formatting.

Use SPF/DKIM/DMARC tools if available to verify sender domain.

Contact the sender through another channel (e.g., call them) if in doubt.

6. What tools can analyze email headers?
Email headers show the path and authenticity of an email. Tools to analyze them include:

Google’s Message Header Analyzer (for Gmail)

MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer

Microsoft Message Header Analyzer Add-in

Mailheader.org

These tools help detect spoofing, relay hops, and sender impersonation.

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
Do NOT click links or download attachments

Report the email to your IT/security team or email provider

Mark it as phishing/spam in your inbox

Delete the email immediately

Warn others in your organization if it's a targeted attack

If you clicked something, change your passwords and run a full antivirus scan immediately

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into doing something or giving away information. In phishing:

They pretend to be trusted figures (boss, IT dept, bank)

Create a sense of urgency or fear

Use personalized information (like your name or company role)

Exploit curiosity, greed, or sympathy

Example: “Your paycheck was delayed – please verify your account to receive it today.”
